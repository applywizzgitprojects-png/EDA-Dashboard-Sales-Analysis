🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Harshitsankhwar/EDA-and-Dashboard-project.git
cd EDA-and-Dashboard-project


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`


Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Dashboard

To launch the interactive dashboard:

streamlit run dashboard/app.py


This will open the dashboard in your default web browser.
